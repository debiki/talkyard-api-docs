Documentation for moderators of a Talkyard site.

That is, if someone created a Talkyard forum or blog comments site, and added
you as a moderator, to help out with reviewing and approving new posts.

These docs are also for administrators, since admins can be moderators too,
if they want.

Docs not written yet.
