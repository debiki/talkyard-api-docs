Nofollow Links
=================

All links posted to your Talkyard site automatically become `rel=nofollow`
except for links within the forum itself.

To remove `nofollow` from links to your own domains, go here, as admin:
`/-/admin/settings/site` and type your domains in the **Your domains** text field.
Typing `example.com` is enough — subdomains like `www.example.com` are included.

You can remove `nofollow` from links to third party websites too — type their
domains in the **Follow links to** text field.

These settings affect everyone — from new members and full members, to admins.

We've split the nofollow settings in two — your own domains, and external domains
you want to allow followed links to (i.e. remove `rel=nofollow`)
— because future AI integrations might want to know which domains are yours,
e.g. to determine if new posts are on-topic or not.
