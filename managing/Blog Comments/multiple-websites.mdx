Multiple Websites
=================


You can use a sinlge Talkyard site for more than one website or blog.

For example, let's say you have documentation website at `docs.example.com`, 
and you want to let people post comments and ask about the docs.

And you have a blog at `blog.example.com`, and a third blog at `blog.sub.example.com`.

To make this work, you need to configure **Allow embedding from**
and list all your domains where you'll embed Talkyard comments.
