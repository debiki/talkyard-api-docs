Multiple Websites
=================

A single Talkyard site can show comments for many blogs and websites.

A commenter will have the same user account and username across all those blogs
and websites. And, if you use your Talkyard site as a discussion forum too
(accessible at say `https://forum.example.com`), s/he would have the same username
there too.

Let's say you have a blog at `blog.example.com`,
another blog at `blog.sub.example.com`,
and a documentation website at `docs.example.com`,
and you want people to post comments and ask questions about your blog posts and docs.

To make this work, then, as admin for your Talkyard site:

1. Go to **Settings | Features**, here: `http:// your talkyard site /-/admin/settings/features`,

    1. Tick **Enable API**. This let's you specify reference IDs in the create-category
        dialog (see below).

    1. Tick **Enable discussion forum** _(note: cannot be undone, but doesn't matter,
        just makes category and tags related buttons visible in the user interface
        if accessing your Talkyard site directly. But not for blog commenters)_.
        — This lets you create _categories_, so you can put comments from different websites,
        in different categories, and have some order.

    1.  If you want, de-select tags, chat, direct messages. You only need API and categories.
    1.  Click **Save**.

1. Create categories. Click **Back from Admin Area** at the top,
    then click **View categories** below the site title.
    Click **Create Category** to the right.
    In our example, we'd create these: "Blog Comments", "Sub Blog comments",
    and "Docs Comments".

    Also click **External ID** at the bottom of the Create Category dialog,
    and type a reference id,
    so you can reference these categories from your websites.
    In our example, we could pick IDs `blog_comments`, `sub_blog_comments`
    and `docs_comments`. (Anything that works for you.)

1. Go to **Settings | Embedded Comments**, here: `/-/admin/settings/embedded-comments`
    and, in **Allow embedding from**,
    type the domains where you'll embed Talkyard comments.
    In our examlpe, that'd be:

    ```
    https://blog.example.com
    https://blog.sub.example.com
    https://docs.example.com
    ````

1. For each blog or website where you're adding comments, select the blogging
    platform you use, in the **Which blog do you use? Or static site generator?**
    section. These buttons don't do anything except for showing different
    instructions. It's fine to use different blogging platforms, for different
    blogs and websites of yours.

    When you add the embedding code snippets, also add a `data-category` attribute,
    and set it to `rid:REFERENCE_ID`, where the REFERENCE_ID is one of the IDs
    you specified above (`blog_comments`, `sub_blog_comments`
    and `docs_comments` in our example). — This tells Talkyrad to place comments
    from [the website you're configuring] in the category with reference ID `REFERENCE_ID`.

    Here's how it can look:
    <pre>{`<div class="talkyard-comments"
          `}<b>{`data-category="rid:sub_blog_comments"`}</b>{`
          data-discussion-id="{{comment_id}}">`}</pre>

    (That's with Ghost as blogging platform — Ghost wants the discussion id specified as
    `{{comment_id}}`, the last line above. But the `data-category=...` is the same,
    regardless of what platform you use.)

1. Redeploy your blogs and websites to activate the blog comments HTML.


That should be it. Post a test comment on each website and see what happens.
