Maybe delete this? There won't be any gigantic Reference menu that works
for everyone? `[one_gigantic_or_a_few_smaller_reference_menus]`

Instead, there'll be 3 different Reference menus?

One for end users' perspective, in the sidebar of the **For Users** docs section,
another from moderators' perspective in the **Mods** section,
and one from admins' perspective in the **Admins** section?

For now, I've just removed the Reference menu item from the topbar.
