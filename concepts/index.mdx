Here we'll write about cognitive biases and other psychological tendencies, and
how you can use Talkyard to mitigate some of them, and thereby make better
decisions together in your organization.

But we've just gotten started implementing anti-bias features. Probably won't
be anything usable until sometime in 2026. â€” Except for
anonymous comments, which we've implemented already, but for now now
they're designed for sensitive discussions, rather than better decision making.

We'll also write about other topics related to people, discussions
and Talkyard.
