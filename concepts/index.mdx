Here we'll write about cognitive biases and other psychological tendencies, and
how you can use Talkyard to mitigate some of them, and thereby make better
decisions together in your organization.

But we've just gotten started implementing anti biases features. Probably won't
be anything you can actually use, until some time next year 2026. â€” Except for
anonymous comments, which we've implemented already, but that's right now
intended for sensitive discussions, rather than better decision making.

And we'll write about other things too related to people and discussions
and Talkyard. A bit theoretical background knowledge.
