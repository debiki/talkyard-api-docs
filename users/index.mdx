Here you can learn about how to use Talkyard,
such as subscribing to notifications, sending direct messages,
navigating big discussions.

If you're a moderator or administrator, click the **Mods** or **Admins** link
in the navigation bar above.

But we haven't written most of the end-user documentation yet (as of July 2025).

Currently there are some docs here: https://forum.talkyard.io/latest/docs
â€” some for users, some for mods and admins.
