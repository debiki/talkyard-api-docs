Here you can learn about how to use Talkyard,
e.g. subscribing to notifications, sending direct messages,
navigating big discussions.

But we haven't written most of these end user docs yet (as of July 2025).

if you're a moderator or administrator, have a look at the
**Mods** and **Admins** sections too
(click those links above in the navigation bar).

Currently there's some docs here,
some for users, some for mods or admins: https://forum.talkyard.io/latest/docs
