Here you can see specs generated by ChatGPT and Gemini,
when I gave them: ./pub-api-2-ai.ts + the prompts you'll find here in this directory.

In the end, it seemed better to write the specs myself, but they did some
helpful & boring generation of enums and other boilerplate things that can be
copy-pasted.
